# App Development Guide

This document covers the patterns all apps in this monorepo follow. Read it before generating or modifying any app.

## Runtime globals

The hub injects these globals into every app at runtime:

```js
const CONTEXT         = window.__CONTEXT_URL    ?? "";  // fetch family context (members, etc.)
const DB              = window.__DB_URL         ?? "";  // SQL database endpoint (storage:"db" apps only)
const STORE           = window.__STORE_URL      ?? "";  // key-value store
const FILES           = window.__FILES_URL      ?? "";  // file upload endpoint
const DOCS            = window.__DOCS_URL       ?? "";  // hub-native document storage (see below)
const CROSS_WRITE_URL = window.__CROSS_WRITE_URL ?? ""; // cross-app writes (hub-sdk crossWrite uses this)
const APPEND_RECORD   = window.__APPEND_RECORD_URL ?? ""; // append-only D1 records (append_only_records apps only)
const CLAIM_URL       = window.__CLAIM_URL      ?? "";  // atomic capacity claims (slot_claims apps only)
const RELEASE_URL     = window.__RELEASE_URL    ?? "";  // release caller's slot claim
const SWAP_URL        = window.__SWAP_URL       ?? "";  // claim destination slot, then release source slot
const APP_ID          = window.__APP_ID         ?? "my-app";
const ME              = window.__CURRENT_MEMBER ?? null; // { id, name, role }
const EVENTS_URL      = window.__EVENTS_URL     ?? "/api/events";
```

`ME` is null in demo mode (no logged-in user). Always guard against it.

## DB helper

Every app that uses SQL defines this helper:

```js
async function db(sql, params = []) {
  if (!DB) return { rows: [] };
  const res = await fetch(DB, {
    method: "POST",
    headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    body: JSON.stringify({ sql, params }),
  });
  return res.json(); // { rows: [...] }
}
```

Schema is managed by hub migrations in `migrations/001_init.sql` — do not run `CREATE TABLE` at runtime.

Every table that stores per-household data **must** declare `household_id` as `UUID`, not `TEXT`:

```sql
household_id UUID NOT NULL DEFAULT current_setting('app.household_id', true)::uuid,
```

Using `TEXT` causes a Postgres type error (`operator does not exist: text = uuid`) when the hub queries app storage usage, and breaks row-level security policies that compare the column as a uuid.

## hub-sdk.js

Import shared utilities from `/hub-sdk.js`:

```js
import { memberColor, initial, esc, isAdult, hubConfirm, hubAlert, formatRelativeDate, fmtMoney, fmtMoneyShort } from "/hub-sdk.js";
```

- `memberColor(memberId, members)` — deterministic color string for a member's avatar
- `initial(name)` — first letter of a name for avatar display
- `esc(str)` — HTML-escape a string before injecting into innerHTML
- `isAdult(member, members)` — returns true if the member has role "adult"
- `hubConfirm({ message, description?, confirmLabel?, destructive? })` — async confirm dialog; returns true/false
- `hubAlert(message, { description?, confirmLabel? })` — async single-button notification dialog. **Always use this instead of `alert()`.** A raw `alert()` fires the browser's native dialog, which inside the hub iframe renders as an "an embedded page at …app… says" popup with stripped-down chrome — confusing and off-brand. `hubAlert` posts to the parent hub frame, which renders the message in the hub's own themed dialog. Same idea for confirmations: use `hubConfirm`, never `confirm()`.
- `fmtMoney(cents)` — format integer cents as USD with no decimals: `fmtMoney(125000)` → `"$1,250"`. Returns `"—"` for null.
- `fmtMoneyShort(cents)` — compact format for large amounts: `$450K`, `$1.3M`. Use for summary displays.
- `createStreamHelper(streamUrl, eventType, callback)` — opens an SSE connection to `window.__STREAM_URL` and calls `callback(event)` for each event. Auto-reconnects on close. Returns `{ connect(), disconnect() }`. Pass `null` as `eventType` to receive all event types.

Always use `esc()` when rendering user-provided strings into HTML templates.

### Updating hub-sdk.js

The **canonical source is `packages/hub-contract/src/hub-sdk.js` in the chickadeebandit hub repo** — edit it there (assumes the hub repo is checked out as a sibling of the apps repo). There is no copy of the SDK in this repo: `dev.mjs` fetches the deployed hub's `/hub-sdk.js` (caching it as the gitignored `.hub-sdk.js`, refreshed every 24 h), and production apps import the same URL directly.

Apps do **not** bundle the SDK — `build.mjs` only packages `manifest.json` + `src/`, and every `dev.mjs` fetches the SDK over the network. So don't add a per-app `hub-sdk.js`; any such copy is vestigial and used by nothing.

After editing the canonical copy, sync the hub's served copy and commit both in the hub repo:

```bash
# in the hub repo, packages/hub:
npm run sync-contract-assets   # copies hub-contract/src/hub-sdk.js → public/hub-sdk.js
```

A local CI guard in the hub repo (`packages/hub/__tests__/unit/hub-sdk-sync.test.ts`) fails if `public/hub-sdk.js` drifts from the package source, so a forgotten sync is caught automatically. A new helper becomes available to apps (dev and prod alike) once the hub deploys.

## Loading members

```js
async function loadMembers() {
  if (!CONTEXT) {
    members = [/* demo fallback */];
    return;
  }
  try {
    const res = await fetch(`${CONTEXT}?keys=family.members`);
    members = ((await res.json())["family.members"]) ?? [];
  } catch { members = []; }
}
```

## Notifications

```js
import { sendHubNotification, hubAppUrl } from "/hub-sdk.js";

await sendHubNotification({
  title: "New event",
  body: "Please RSVP",
  audience: ["member-id-1", "member-id-2"],
  url: hubAppUrl(APP_ID, { eventId }),
});
```

Prefer `sendHubNotification` from `/hub-sdk.js` over hand-written `fetch(window.__NOTIFY_URL...)`
calls. It sends through the app-scoped hub endpoint, defaults click targets to `/open/{APP_ID}`,
and normalizes old `/run/{APP_ID}` URLs so Safari and other browsers open the app in the hub shell
instead of the isolated runtime origin. It returns the hub response JSON (`{ web, expo }`) or `null`
on network failure, so apps may show delivery diagnostics when useful. Notifications are still
best-effort; don't make core data writes depend on them succeeding.

**The default `audience` is `"all"` — the whole household.** Never send the contents of a
restricted item (a private/role/board-only channel message, an adults-only note, etc.)
through the plain `notify` helper: every member's device receives the preview, even members
who can't open the item. To target specific people, pass an explicit member-id list:
`audience: ["member-id-1", "member-id-2"]`. But you usually can't compute
"who follows this channel" on the client (that data is `owner_only`) — use
`subscription_notify` below.

### `subscription_notify` — notify a topic's followers without leaking previews

For "follow this channel / thread / event and get notified of new activity", declare
`subscription_notify`. The hub exposes `POST /run/{appId}/api/notify-subscribers`, which
reads your per-member opt-in table (kept `owner_only`, so the client can't read other
members' rows), unions in any explicit `also_notify` ids (e.g. @mentions), drops the
sender, then **re-checks that each recipient may still see the topic** before pushing only
to them. The caller must also be eligible for the topic (a non-member can't trigger
notifications into a channel they're not in).

**Why you can't do this with the plain `notify` helper:** subscriptions are `owner_only`,
so a member's browser can only read *its own* follow rows — it can't resolve, let alone
fan out to, the full follower list. And `owner_only` lets any member opt into any topic id,
so the recipient list must be re-filtered server-side or a non-member who subscribed to a
private channel would receive its previews.

```jsonc
// manifest.json — the subscription table must have an owner_only row policy
{
  "row_policies": {
    "channel_subscriptions": { "kind": "owner_only", "member_column": "member_id", "adults_bypass": false }
  },
  "subscription_notify": {
    "subscription_table": "channel_subscriptions",
    "topic_column": "channel_id",
    "member_column": "member_id",
    "eligibility": {
      "kind": "channel_membership",
      "channels_table": "channels",
      "membership_type_column": "membership_type",   // must be plaintext (db_plaintext_columns)
      "membership_roles_column": "membership_roles",  // must be plaintext
      "membership_table": "channel_members",
      "membership_channel_column": "channel_id",
      "membership_member_column": "member_id"
    }
  }
}
```

```js
// Follow / unfollow is just an owner_only write of the caller's own row:
await db(`INSERT INTO app_x__channel_subscriptions (channel_id, member_id) VALUES (?, ?) ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`, [channelId, ME.id]);
await db(`DELETE FROM app_x__channel_subscriptions WHERE channel_id = ? AND member_id = ?`, [channelId, ME.id]);

// After a new message, fan out (fire-and-forget) through the hub:
await fetch(window.__NOTIFY_SUBSCRIBERS_URL, {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    topic_id: channelId,
    title: `#${channelName}`,
    body: `${ME.name}: ${text.slice(0, 80)}`,
    url: `/run/${APP_ID}?channelId=${channelId}`,
    also_notify: mentionedMemberIds,   // optional — unioned with followers, still eligibility-checked
  }),
}).catch(() => {});
```

`eligibility.kind: "channel_membership"` mirrors the `channel_scoped` row policy
(`all` / `role` / `custom` membership). `channels_id_column` defaults to `"id"`;
`all_value`/`role_value` default to `"all"`/`"role"`. The `membership_type`/`membership_roles`
columns must be plaintext (the same requirement `channel_scoped` imposes). `group-channels`
is the reference implementation.

## Activity log

Many apps log user actions to an `activity` table:

```js
async function logActivity(recordId, action, detail = "") {
  const id = crypto.randomUUID();
  await db(
    `INSERT INTO activity (id, record_id, actor_id, action, detail, created_at) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)`,
    [id, recordId, ME?.id ?? "system", action, detail, new Date().toISOString()]
  );
}
```

## Optimistic local state updates

After a main DB write succeeds, update local state immediately and re-render — do **not** reload from the database. A reload adds a full round-trip before the user sees any feedback.

```js
async function createItem(fields) {
  const id  = crypto.randomUUID();
  const now = new Date().toISOString();

  // 1. Write to DB
  await db(`INSERT INTO items (id, title, created_at) VALUES (?, ?, ?)`, [id, fields.title, now]);

  // 2. Update local state and render immediately
  items = [{ id, title: fields.title, created_at: now, status: "active" }, ...items];
  closeModal();
  render();

  // 3. Fire side effects in the background — don't block the UI
  Promise.all([
    logActivity(id, "created", `${ME.name} created "${fields.title}"`),
    notify(`New item: ${fields.title}`, `${ME.name} added a new item.`),
    fetch("/api/activity", { method: "POST", headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
      body: JSON.stringify({ type: "item_created", actor: ME.name,
        description: `${ME.name} created "${fields.title}"`,
        metadata: { deepLink: { appId: APP_ID, params: { itemId: id } } } }),
    }).catch(() => {}),
  ]).catch(() => {});
}
```

For updates and deletes, patch the array in-place:

```js
// update
const idx = items.findIndex(i => i.id === id);
if (idx !== -1) items[idx] = { ...items[idx], title: fields.title, updated_at: now };

// delete
items = items.filter(i => i.id !== id);
```

Never re-fetch the full list from the DB just to reflect a change you already know about.

## Member lookup map

Build a `Map` once after `loadMembers()` completes. Use it everywhere instead of `.find()` — avoids an O(n) scan on every card render.

```js
let members   = [];
let memberMap = new Map();

async function loadMembers() {
  if (!CONTEXT) {
    members = [{ id: "demo-1", name: "Alex", role: "adult" }, /* … */];
    memberMap = new Map(members.map(m => [m.id, m]));
    return;
  }
  try {
    const res = await fetch(`${CONTEXT}?keys=family.members`);
    members = ((await res.json())["family.members"]) ?? [];
  } catch { members = []; }
  memberMap = new Map(members.map(m => [m.id, m]));
}

// Use map lookups everywhere — not .find()
function memberName(id) { return memberMap.get(id)?.name ?? "Unknown"; }
```

## Parallelizing independent async calls

`loadMembers()` and `loadItems()` are independent — run them in parallel at startup:

```js
(async () => {
  await Promise.all([loadMembers(), loadItems()]);
  render();
  handleDeepLink();
})();
```

Side effects like `logActivity`, `notify`, and `/api/activity` are also independent of each other — batch them in a fire-and-forget `Promise.all` after the UI has already updated (see optimistic local state above). Never chain them sequentially with separate `await` calls.

## Modal pattern

Most apps use a single `modalEl` variable:

```js
let modalEl = null;
function openModal(html) {
  closeModal();
  modalEl = document.createElement("div");
  modalEl.className = "modal-backdrop";
  modalEl.innerHTML = `<div class="modal">${html}</div>`;
  modalEl.addEventListener("click", e => { if (e.target === modalEl) closeModal(); });
  document.body.appendChild(modalEl);
}
function closeModal() { modalEl?.remove(); modalEl = null; }
```

Use `openModal` for rich, app-styled content (forms, multi-button flows, anything with custom markup). For a one-off message or a yes/no question, **do not reach for the native `alert()`/`confirm()`** — they render as the browser's "an embedded page says" iframe popup. Use `hubAlert(message)` / `hubConfirm(message)` from `/hub-sdk.js` instead; they render in the hub's own themed dialog. Reserve a bespoke `openModal` only when the notification needs an action beyond a plain OK (e.g. the partner-pairing "Waiting for…" modal with a **Check Again** button that re-polls).

## Loading state on submit buttons

Any async submit handler must disable its button immediately so the user knows work is in progress:

```js
window.submitForm = async function(existingId) {
  // 1. validate first — bail before touching UI
  const name = document.getElementById("f-name").value.trim();
  if (!name) { document.getElementById("f-name").focus(); return; }

  // 2. disable the button
  const btn = modalEl?.querySelector('.modal-actions .btn-primary');
  if (btn) { btn.disabled = true; btn.textContent = 'Saving…'; }

  // 3. do async work — on success, closeModal() removes the button from DOM
  try {
    await saveRecord({ name });
    closeModal();
    render();
  } catch (e) {
    // restore so user can retry
    if (btn) { btn.disabled = false; btn.textContent = existingId ? 'Save' : 'Create'; }
    throw e;
  }
};
```

For buttons outside a modal (e.g. an inline Add button), find them directly:

```js
const btn = document.querySelector('.add-btn');
if (btn) { btn.disabled = true; btn.textContent = 'Adding…'; }
await addItem(val);
if (btn) { btn.disabled = false; btn.textContent = 'Add'; }
```

## Hub CSS variables

Apps inherit these CSS custom properties from the hub theme at runtime:

```css
--hub-bg           /* page background */
--hub-surface      /* card/panel background */
--hub-border       /* default border color */
--hub-text         /* primary text */
--hub-text-muted   /* secondary/muted text */
--hub-primary      /* accent color (buttons, links) */
--hub-primary-fg   /* foreground on accent color */
--hub-primary-hover
--hub-radius       /* border-radius for cards/buttons */
--hub-font-size    /* base font size */
--hub-font         /* font-family */
```

Always define fallback values: `var(--hub-bg, #f9fafb)`.

## Deep linking

The hub can open an app at a specific item by appending query params to the iframe URL. Apps that support deep linking should read those params on startup and navigate to the referenced item.

### Handling incoming deep-link params

Read `window.location.search` during init and navigate to the referenced item if params are present:

```js
function handleDeepLink() {
  const params = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
  const pollId = params.get("pollId");
  if (pollId) openPoll(pollId);
}

(async () => {
  await Promise.all([loadMembers(), loadItems()]);
  handleDeepLink(); // after data is loaded so the item exists
  render();
})();
```

Pick param names that are specific to your app (e.g. `pollId`, `taskId`, `recipeId`). The hub passes whatever params were in the link — there is no shared namespace.

### Navigating to another app with params

Use the `hub:open` postMessage to send the user to a specific item in another app:

```js
window.parent.postMessage({
  type: "hub:open",
  appId: "grocery",
  params: { listId: "abc123" },
}, "*");
```

The hub navigates to `/open/grocery?listId=abc123`, which passes `?listId=abc123` into the grocery app's iframe.

### Logging activity with a deep link

When you log hub-level activity (via `/api/activity` or a hub SDK helper), include a `deepLink` in the metadata so the activity item and notification bell become clickable links:

```js
await fetch("/api/activity", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    type: "poll_created",
    description: `${ME.name} created a new poll: "${title}"`,
    metadata: {
      deepLink: {
        appId: APP_ID,
        params: { pollId: id },
      },
    },
  }),
}).catch(() => {});
```

The hub renders that activity entry as a link to `/open/{appId}?pollId={id}`. Without `deepLink`, the entry is plain text.

## Events API

Publish cross-app events other apps can consume:

```js
await fetch(EVENTS_URL, {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    source_app_id: APP_ID,
    type: "event.type",       // e.g. "allowance.weekly"
    subject_id: memberId,
    payload: { /* ... */ },
  }),
}).catch(() => {});
```

If your manifest declares `publishes` and/or `alert_on`, you **must** call the events endpoint in app code after the relevant action — declaring these fields alone does nothing. Always call it as a fire-and-forget side effect after the UI has already updated.

### `publish_acls` — gating who may emit an event

Any household member can POST to your app's events endpoint. If an event carries value another app acts on (e.g. `reward.earned` → piggy-bank credits allowance), gate it so only adults can emit it:

```json
{
  "publishes": ["reward.earned", "item.closed"],
  "publish_acls": {
    "reward.earned": { "require_role": "adult" },
    "item.closed":   { "require_role": "adult" }
  }
}
```

The hub enforces `require_role` server-side when the events endpoint is called — a child POSTing the event directly gets a 403. Declare `publish_acls` for any event whose payload another app treats as authoritative.

## File uploads

Use `createFilesHelper` from `/hub-sdk.js` for all file operations. It handles correct URL construction, upload error detection, and deletion — do not roll your own `fetch` calls against `FILES`.

```js
import { createFilesHelper } from "/hub-sdk.js";
const files = createFilesHelper(window.__FILES_URL ?? "");
```

**Upload** — resolves with `{ id, url }` or throws on any server error (wrong MIME type → 415, too large → 413, storage limit → 507). Never insert a DB record until `upload()` resolves successfully.

```js
async function uploadFile(file) {
  const { id: fileId, url: fileUrl } = await files.upload(file);
  // now safe to insert into your DB
}
```

**Delete** — takes the file ID (not a URL):

```js
await files.delete(fileId).catch(() => {});
```

**List** — returns `{ files, totalBytes, limit }`:

```js
const { files: fileList, totalBytes, limit } = await files.list();
```

**Get a file URL** — for linking or displaying:

```js
const url = files.url(fileId);  // e.g. /run/{app-id}/api/files/{id}
```

**Show the upload area only when files are available** (guard against demo mode):

```js
const uploadHtml = window.__FILES_URL ? `<div class="upload-area">…</div>` : "";
```

Allowed MIME types: `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `image/webp`, `image/gif`, `image/heic`, `image/heif`, `application/pdf`, `application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document` (docx), `application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet` (xlsx), `text/plain`, `text/markdown`.

## Hub-native document storage

For documents that should persist in the hub (survive app reinstall, appear in the household document library, respect encryption at rest), use `window.__DOCS_URL` instead of — or alongside — your own app DB.

```js
const DOCS = window.__DOCS_URL ?? "";
```

**Create** — POST a document record. `fileKey` is the ID returned by `files.upload()`.

```js
const { id } = await fetch(DOCS, {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    title:    file.name,           // required
    category: "home",              // required: medical | legal | home | financial | other
    fileKey:  uploadResult.id,     // from files.upload()
    mimeType: file.type,
    sizeBytes: file.size,
    sourceId: itemId,              // optional: link to your own entity (e.g. a maintenance item)
    folder:   "Warranties",        // optional: freeform grouping label
    sharedWith: ["everyone"],      // optional: [] = owner-only, ["everyone"] = whole household
  }),
}).then(r => r.json());
```

**List** — GET with optional filters:

```js
const docs = await fetch(`${DOCS}?sourceId=${itemId}`).then(r => r.json());
// also: ?folder=Warranties
```

**Delete** — DELETE by document ID (also delete the associated file):

```js
await fetch(`${DOCS}/${docId}`, { method: "DELETE" });
await files.delete(doc.fileKey).catch(() => {});
```

Hub documents are automatically deleted when the app is uninstalled. Storage usage counts against the app's `max_docs_bytes` limit (default 100 MB). Guard against demo mode:

```js
const uploadHtml = window.__DOCS_URL ? `<div class="upload-area">…</div>` : "";
```

## Cross-app data sharing

Apps can read and write each other's KV store data. Both sides must declare intent in their manifests; the hub enforces both at runtime.

### Exposing data to other apps

Declare the KV keys you want to make readable (or writable) by other apps:

```json
{
  "exports": ["recipes", "pending_items"]
}
```

Export key names must be lowercase alphanumeric, hyphens, or underscores.

### Reading another app's exported key

Declare the key in `data_access.reads` using the pattern `app.{appId}.{key}`:

```json
{
  "data_access": {
    "reads": ["family.members", "app.recipes.recipes"],
    "writes": []
  }
}
```

Then fetch it the same way as any context key:

```js
const res = await fetch(`${CONTEXT}?keys=app.recipes.recipes`);
const data = await res.json();
const recipes = data["app.recipes.recipes"] ?? [];
```

The hub returns the parsed JSON value of the source app's KV entry for that key. Returns `null` if the key hasn't been written yet.

### Writing to another app's exported key

Declare the key in `data_access.writes`:

```json
{
  "data_access": {
    "reads": [],
    "writes": ["app.grocery.pending_items"]
  }
}
```

Then use `crossWrite` from `/hub-sdk.js`:

```js
import { crossWrite } from "/hub-sdk.js";

await crossWrite("grocery", "pending_items", [
  { op: "array_append", path: "items", value: { name: "Flour", addedBy: "Meal Planner" } },
  { op: "array_append", path: "items", value: { name: "Eggs",  addedBy: "Meal Planner" } },
]);
```

`crossWrite` uses the same patch ops as the KV store PATCH endpoint: `array_append`, `array_remove`, `set`, `increment`, `delete`. The `path` is a dotted path within the JSON blob stored at the key.

Writes count against the **calling** app's daily write quota, not the target app's.

### The inbox pattern (for `storage: db` apps)

DB-storage apps can't receive writes directly into their SQL schema. Instead, expose a KV key as an inbox, then drain it on load:

```js
async function processPendingInbox() {
  if (!STORE) return;
  try {
    const res = await fetch(`${STORE}?key=pending_items`);
    if (!res.ok) return;
    const { value } = await res.json();
    if (!value) return;
    const pending = JSON.parse(value).items ?? [];
    if (!pending.length) return;

    for (const item of pending) {
      const name = typeof item.name === "string" ? item.name.trim() : "";
      if (!name) continue;
      await db(`INSERT INTO items (...) VALUES (...)`, [...])
        .catch(() => {}); // silently ignore duplicates
    }

    await fetch(`${STORE}?key=pending_items`, { method: "DELETE" });
  } catch { /* non-fatal */ }
}
```

Call it during init before loading your main data:

```js
(async () => {
  await loadMembers();
  await processPendingInbox(); // drain inbox first
  await loadItems();
  render();
})();
```

The inbox key must be listed in `exports`. Keep inbox processing non-fatal — always wrap in try/catch and never let it block the app from loading.

### Permission escalation

When an app update **adds** new cross-app reads, writes, or exports, the hub automatically queues the update for admin approval even if `requires_approval` is `false` in the manifest. The admin will see a callout in the update review screen explaining what new access was added.

## Resource limits

The hub injects current limits into `window.__RESOURCE_LIMITS`:

```js
const LIMITS = window.__RESOURCE_LIMITS ?? {};
// LIMITS.max_file_bytes      — max bytes per individual upload (default 10 MB)
// LIMITS.max_files_bytes     — max total file storage for this app (default 500 MB)
// LIMITS.max_db_bytes        — max DB storage for this app (default 200 MB)
// LIMITS.max_store_bytes     — max KV storage for this app
// LIMITS.max_store_reads_per_day
// LIMITS.max_store_writes_per_day
```

Apps do not need to enforce these limits themselves — the hub enforces them and returns 507 when exceeded. But apps may read them to display a storage bar or warn the user before an upload.

## Nav label

Every app must include a `nav` field in `manifest.json` so it appears in the hub's left navigation by default:

```json
"nav": { "label": "My App" }
```

Use a short label (1–2 words). Never omit this field — apps without it are invisible in the nav until an admin manually enables them.

## Base href

Every app sets `<base href="/run/{app-id}/">` in `<head>` so relative asset paths resolve correctly inside the hub iframe.

## Extracting testable logic

Apps with non-trivial pure logic should extract it into `src/logic.js` so it can be unit-tested without a browser environment.

**Pattern:**

1. `src/shared.js` — mirrors any `hub-sdk.js` functions used by logic (e.g. `isAdult`, `esc`). Tests import from here instead of the browser-only SDK.

2. `src/logic.js` — exports pure functions. Import from `shared.js`, not `/hub-sdk.js`:

```js
import { isAdult } from "./shared.js";
export { isAdult };

export function canSeeItem(item, me) {
  if (isAdult(me)) return true;
  return item.visibility === "public";
}
```

3. `src/index.html` — imports from both `/hub-sdk.js` (browser globals) and `./logic.js` (pure functions). Use aliased imports to avoid shadowing if you wrap them with local state:

```js
import { esc, isAdult, hubConfirm } from "/hub-sdk.js";
import { canSeeItem as _canSeeItem } from "./logic.js";

// thin wrapper that binds to app state
function canSeeItem(item) { return _canSeeItem(item, ME); }
```

4. `__tests__/logic.test.mjs` — imports from `../src/logic.js`. No DOM, no mocks needed for pure functions.

**When to extract logic:**
- Access control checks (who can see/edit/vote)
- Derived status or computed values from raw data
- Non-trivial filtering or sorting
- Date/money formatting with edge cases

**When not to:** DB calls, render functions, event handlers, and anything that closes over module-level state belong in the HTML script and don't need extraction.

## Behavioral scenarios (`scenarios.json`)

`logic.test.mjs` unit-tests pure front-end functions; it does **not** exercise
the hub runtime, so it cannot prove your `row_policies`, `publishes`, or named
queries actually behave as intended end-to-end. The hub's Layer 2b
**app-exercise** suite already runs a universal pass over every app (installs
it, drives each declared capability against the real runtime, and asserts the
generic per-policy-kind security invariants) — you get that for free with no
per-app files.

For behavior the universal pass can't infer — private-visibility isolation,
couple/party scoping, event→query flows, protocol lifecycles — add an optional
`scenarios.json` **next to `manifest.json`**. Each scenario declares members by
role and a list of steps replayed against the real runtime; expectations are
checked against the result. `build.mjs` ships it in the bundle, and the hub's
nightly fan-in replays it against your published bundle. `contract-ci` lints the
file's shape and references (declared events / named SQL / member aliases) in
your app's own CI — no hub install needed — so a broken spec fails fast.

```jsonc
{
  "scenarios": [
    {
      "name": "private items are hidden from non-owners; shared items are visible",
      "members": { "owner": "adult", "other": "adult" },
      "steps": [
        // seedRaw bypasses row policies — for setting up endpoint_only /
        // protocol-managed tables (e.g. partner_config) the app can't write.
        { "action": "seedRaw", "sql": "INSERT INTO app_x__partner_config (member_id, partner_id) VALUES (?, ?)", "params": ["{{owner}}", "{{other}}"] },
        // db/named/publish/store/context steps run AS a member, THROUGH policies.
        { "action": "db", "as": "owner", "sql": "INSERT INTO app_x__items (id, member_id, visibility) VALUES (?, ?, ?)", "params": ["i1", "{{owner}}", "private"], "expect": { "status": 200 } },
        { "action": "db", "as": "other", "sql": "SELECT id FROM app_x__items", "expect": { "status": 200, "rowCount": 0 } }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Step actions: `seedRaw` (policy-bypassing setup), `db`, `named`
(`{kind, name}` ai_access SQL), `publish` (`{type, subject_id?, payload?}`),
`store` (`{method, key?, value?}`), `context` (`{keys}`). `as` names a member
from `members` (defaults to the first); `{{alias}}` interpolates that member's
id into `params`/`value`. `expect` supports `status`, `rowCount`, `rowsContain`
(subset match), and `errorIncludes`. The schema is `ScenariosFileSchema` in the
hub's `@chickadee/hub-contract`. Reference examples: `tasks/scenarios.json`
(private-visibility) and `couples-bucket-list/scenarios.json` (couple scoping).

## Demo mode

When `DB` and `CONTEXT` are empty strings (local development or demo), the app should work with hardcoded demo data. Never crash or show an error when these are missing — show sample data instead.

## Security constraints

### Migration SQL

Each household gets its own isolated SQLite (Cloudflare D1) database. Migrations live in
`migrations/001_init.sql` (add `002_*.sql`, etc. for later versions) and are applied in
ascending order, skipping versions already applied. Migrations must be additive only
(`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`, `CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS`, `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN` —
bare `ADD COLUMN` without `IF NOT EXISTS` is correct; the migration runner's version
tracking ensures each migration runs exactly once, so SQL-level idempotency guards are
not needed and SQLite does not support `ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS` anyway).

**Table naming**: every table name — in migrations *and* in app SQL — must be prefixed
with `app_{appId}__` (e.g. app id `streaks` -> `app_streaks__streaks`,
`app_streaks__streak_logs`). The hub's DDL guard rejects any `CREATE TABLE`/`CREATE INDEX`
whose name doesn't start with your app's prefix. IDs are `TEXT` (use
`crypto.randomUUID()` client-side) — there is no `household_id` column; each household's
data already lives in its own database file.

The hub validates and rejects any migration that contains:

- `DROP TABLE` / `DROP COLUMN` / `RENAME COLUMN` / `RENAME TABLE` / `TRUNCATE`
- `CREATE TRIGGER` / `CREATE VIEW` (including the `TEMP` / `TEMPORARY` forms) — trigger and view
  bodies run SQL that the hub cannot scope, so they could read or write other apps' tables and
  bypass per-app table isolation. Do the equivalent work in your app/server code instead.
- `PRAGMA`, `ATTACH DATABASE`, `VACUUM`
- `CREATE TABLE` without `IF NOT EXISTS`
- Any `CREATE`/`DROP`/`ALTER TABLE|INDEX|VIEW|TRIGGER` whose target table name doesn't start with your app's `app_{appId}__` prefix

Row-level access restrictions are **not** expressed in SQL (no `CREATE POLICY`/RLS) —
declare them as `row_policies` in `manifest.json` instead; see "Row-level access control"
below. Anything not declared there is fully readable/writable by any household member
whose session calls `/api/db` — DDL and table layout decide *what* exists, `row_policies`
decides *who* can touch which rows.

### App JavaScript

- Always use `esc()` from `/hub-sdk.js` when injecting any user-provided string into `innerHTML`. Never use raw string interpolation with user data in HTML templates.
- Never construct SQL strings from user input — always use parameterized queries via the `db()` helper with the `params` array.
- The `DB` endpoint only runs queries against your app's own schema. You cannot query other apps' tables or hub tables — this is enforced at the database level.
- Do not attempt to read or write `window.__CONTEXT_URL`, `window.__DB_URL`, or other hub globals from another origin — the iframe sandbox blocks it.

### CDN whitelist

`cdn_whitelist` entries in the manifest must be `https://` origins only (e.g. `"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net"`). No paths, no wildcards, no `http://`. The hub rejects manifests with invalid entries and strips any that bypass validation at CSP-build time.

## Row-level access control (storage: db apps)

By default, `/api/db` runs whatever SQL the app sends against the household's
shared D1 database — **any household member can read or write any row in any
table**, regardless of what the app's UI shows. Client-side checks like
`if (isAdult(ME)) { ... }` are cosmetic only: a child can open devtools and
`fetch` your `DB` endpoint directly with arbitrary SQL.

If your app has data that should be restricted by member, role, or
visibility (private notes, financial accounts, votes, board-only records,
etc.), declare a `row_policies` block in `manifest.json`. The hub rewrites
incoming SQL to add the right `WHERE`/`EXISTS` conditions and forces the
right columns on `INSERT`, **before** your SQL ever reaches the database —
app code cannot bypass it, and a malicious client sending raw SQL gets the
same restrictions.

```json
{
  "storage": "db",
  "row_policies": {
    "<unprefixed_table_name>": { "kind": "...", ... }
  }
}
```

- Keys are **unprefixed** table names (`"streaks"`, not `"app_streaks__streaks"`)
  — the hub adds the `app_{appId}__` prefix automatically.
- Tables with no entry are completely unaffected — opt-in, fully backward compatible.
- Unsupported SQL shapes that reference a governed table (JOINs, aliases,
  subqueries in `FROM`) are **rejected outright** (fail closed) rather than
  silently under-enforced — keep queries against governed tables to simple
  single-table `SELECT`/`INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE`.
- On a policy violation, `/api/db` returns `403` with `{ "error": "..." }`.
- `max_per_member` is an INSERT-only modifier available on any policy kind.
  It enforces at most `limit` rows per member per declared scope inside
  `executeAppSql` (`limit: 1` is the classic "one row per member").
- `max_rows` is an INSERT-only modifier available on any policy kind: a
  table-wide cap on the total number of rows. It also covers rows written by
  external share-link submissions into that table.
- `frozen_when` is a write-freeze modifier available on any policy kind:
  `{ "status_column": "status", "locked_values": ["adopted", "closed"] }`.
  Use it when a row should become immutable after a lifecycle state, such as
  board minutes after adoption, closed trivia rounds, or archived sheets. For
  normal tables, `status_column` lives on that table. For `inherit_visibility`,
  `sealed_until`, and `owner_only_with_fk_check` child tables, it lives on the
  parent/FK table, so child comments, votes, responses, amendments, and records
  cannot be changed after the parent locks. The status column must be plaintext:
  `status` is built in; list custom enum columns in `db_plaintext_columns`.
- `column_read_acls` is a per-column **read-masking** modifier available on any
  policy kind with an owner column. Each listed column's value is returned as
  `null` unless the caller matches its `visible_to`
  (`"owner"` / `"adult"` / `"privileged"`). Use it when the whole row is
  readable but one column is not — a word-game secret word visible only to the
  setter, a valuation column visible only to adults.
- `column_write_acls` is the write-side counterpart of `column_read_acls`:
  it restricts who may write individual columns on `INSERT`/`UPDATE`.
- `retain_days` is a hub-managed **automatic expiry** modifier: the daily
  maintenance runner deletes rows older than `default` days by `timestamp_column`.
  App SQL never gets this power.

### Policy kinds

#### `endpoint_only` — table written exclusively by a trusted hub endpoint

```json
{ "kind": "endpoint_only" }
{ "kind": "endpoint_only", "read": "adult" }
{ "kind": "endpoint_only", "read": "none" }
```

Rejects **all** app-originated INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE with 403. Use when a table is written only by a trusted manifest-driven hub endpoint (e.g. `anonymous_responses`, `anonymous_ballot`). Trusted hub operations bypass row policies entirely and can still write.

- `read` defaults to `"everyone"` — all members may SELECT
- `read: "adult"` — only adults may SELECT (children get 403)
- `read: "none"` — all reads also blocked; results released only through a trusted endpoint (e.g. secret-ballot tallies, anonymous survey responses before session closure)

Example: `responses` and `ballot` tables written by `anonymous_responses` / `anonymous_ballot` hub endpoints, where `read:"none"` keeps raw answers hidden until the session closes.

#### `adult_writable` — everyone reads, only adults write

```json
{ "kind": "adult_writable" }
```

All members may SELECT. INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE require `memberRole === "adult"` — non-adults get 403. This is the right choice for shared content that adults manage (chore definitions, survey questions, poll configuration, announcements) when you don't need per-row ownership.

Add `"member_read_column": "member_id"` to restrict non-adult reads to only their own rows while adults still see all:

```json
{ "kind": "adult_writable", "member_read_column": "member_id" }
```

Example: `chores` definitions (kids read, only adults create/edit); `piggy_banks` and `transactions` with `member_read_column` (kid reads only their own bank, parents read all).

#### `app_config` — a key/value settings table whose values only an admin may write

```json
{ "kind": "app_config" }
```

Read-all, **write-none via `/api/db`**. The only writer is `POST /run/{app}/api/admin-config`, which requires `isAdmin`. Use this for the settings row that names a privileged group (e.g. `board_group_id`) — if that row used `adult_only` instead, any adult could overwrite the group pointer and grant themselves board access. Pair with manifest `admin_config: { settings_table, keys: ["board_group_id"] }`. Used by `dues-contributions` and `reserve-fund`.

#### `owner_only` — a row belongs to exactly one member

```json
{ "kind": "owner_only", "member_column": "member_id", "adults_bypass": true }
```

- Non-adults: every query is restricted to rows where `member_column = <caller's member id>`; `INSERT` forces `member_column` to the caller.
- Adults: unrestricted by default. Set `"adults_bypass": false` to restrict adults too (e.g. each adult only sees their own rows).
- Add `"privileged_groups": [{ "settings_table": "settings", "settings_key": "board_group_id" }]` to give members of a configurable hub group (e.g. "board", "admins") unrestricted access regardless of `adults_bypass`. Add `"actions": ["insert"]` (any subset of `select`/`insert`/`update`/`delete`) to an entry to scope its privilege to those statement kinds, and list multiple entries for per-role power (treasurer inserts, secretary edits). See [`privileged_groups`](#privileged_groups) below.
- Add `"insert_privileged_only": true` (requires a `privileged_groups` entry covering `"insert"`) to block `INSERT` for everyone except the privileged group — returns 403 for all other callers regardless of adult status. SELECT/UPDATE/DELETE are unaffected. `"delete_privileged_only": true` (requires `"delete"` coverage) does the same for DELETE.
- Add `"endpoint_writes_only": true` to block all app-originated INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE while keeping owner-based read filtering in place. Use this when a table's data must only be written by a trusted hub endpoint (e.g. vote receipts created by `anonymous_responses`), but reads should still be filtered by ownership and `adults_bypass`:

```json
{
  "kind": "owner_only",
  "member_column": "member_id",
  "adults_bypass": false,
  "member_can_update": false,
  "endpoint_writes_only": true
}
```

Example: piggy-bank `piggy_banks`/`transactions` — a child only sees their own bank/transactions; adults (parents) see everyone's. Vote receipts for attributed polls — each member can see their own receipt (confirming they voted), but all receipt creation goes through the `submit-response` hub endpoint.

#### `max_per_member` — at most N rows per member per scope

Use `max_per_member` when the row is **not secret** but each member should only
be able to create a bounded number of rows within a logical scope: one RSVP per
event (`limit: 1`), one rating per watchlist title, one guess per trivia round,
up to three votes per poll, and so on.

```json
{
  "kind": "owner_only",
  "member_column": "member_id",
  "adults_bypass": false,
  "max_per_member": {
    "member_column": "member_id",
    "scope_columns": ["event_id"],
    "limit": 1
  }
}
```

- `limit` is a positive integer — the maximum rows one member may hold within
  the scope. `limit: 1` reproduces the classic "exactly one row per member".
- Applies only to `INSERT`; it does not make existing rows immutable.
- The `member_column` and every `scope_columns` entry must be explicitly present
  in the INSERT column list. The policy first applies the base row policy, so
  owner policies still force the member column to the caller before the count
  check runs.
- The hub counts the member's existing matching rows plus the rows in the same
  multi-row INSERT; if the total would exceed `limit`, `/api/db` returns `403`.
- A scope entry may be a plain column name **or** a derived key
  `{ "column": "date", "transform": "month" }`, which buckets an ISO date/datetime
  column by its `"YYYY-MM"` prefix — e.g. "at most N reservations per amenity per
  calendar month". Derived scopes are compared in JS after decryption, so they
  work on encrypted columns and cannot be dodged with a separate stored column.
- This is for **attributed/non-secret** participation. If the answer or ballot
  must not be linkable to the member, use `anonymous_responses` or
  `anonymous_ballot` with a receipt table instead.
- If the row also has a capacity constraint ("claim iff seats/shifts/slots remain"),
  use `slot_claims` instead. A row policy can bound per-member counts, but it cannot
  atomically check `COUNT(existing claims) < capacity` while inserting.

#### `max_rows` — a table-wide row cap

Add `"max_rows": 200` to any policy to cap the total number of rows the table may
hold. On `INSERT`, the hub counts the current rows plus the rows being inserted;
if the total would exceed the cap it rejects the write with a `DB_LIMIT_EXCEEDED`
error (HTTP `507`). The cap also applies to rows written by external
share-link submissions into that table, so it is the declarative replacement for
ad-hoc "max external submissions" guards. It is a coarse abuse ceiling, not a
per-member limit — combine it with `max_per_member` when you need both.

#### `frozen_when` — immutable after adopted / closed / archived

Use `frozen_when` when a table remains writable during drafting or play, but
must stop accepting app-originated writes after a lifecycle state:

```json
{
  "kind": "owner_or_visibility",
  "member_column": "created_by",
  "visibility_column": "visibility",
  "everyone_values": ["household"],
  "write_visibility_scoped": true,
  "frozen_when": {
    "status_column": "status",
    "locked_values": ["adopted", "closed"]
  }
}
```

- Applies to `UPDATE` and `DELETE` of the row once its current status is locked.
  Transitioning into a locked status is allowed; later writes are blocked.
- On `inherit_visibility` and `owner_only_with_fk_check` child tables, the hub
  checks the parent/FK row's `status_column` instead. This is how comments,
  votes, append-like children, or amendments become immutable after the parent
  board minute, round, sheet, or case closes.
- On `sealed_until` child tables, `frozen_when` also checks the parent row. This
  is the common async-game shape: responses stay private until the round closes,
  then the closed round also freezes further edits.
- The `status_column` must be plaintext. `status` is already plaintext; custom
  lifecycle columns such as `round_state` or `workflow_state` must be listed in
  `db_plaintext_columns` before they can be used by `frozen_when`.
- Do not use `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` against a frozen table; the hub
  rejects upsert updates because they could otherwise mutate an already-locked
  row through the conflict tail.

#### `column_read_acls` — mask specific columns while the row stays readable

Use `column_read_acls` when everyone may read the **row** but only some callers
may read a particular **column** — the answer column in a word game, a valuation
or salary column, alumni opt-in contact fields. It is a read-only mask layered on
top of the base policy's row filter.

```json
{
  "kind": "owner_or_visibility",
  "member_column": "member_id",
  "visibility_column": "visibility",
  "everyone_values": ["everyone"],
  "column_read_acls": {
    "secret_word": { "visible_to": ["owner"] }
  }
}
```

- `visible_to` is a non-empty subset of `"owner"`, `"adult"`, `"privileged"`:
  - `"owner"` — the row's owner column equals the caller. The owner column is the
    same one the kind already uses (`member_column`, `self_column`,
    `writer_column`, or `member_read_column` by kind), so `endpoint_only`,
    `adult_only`, and `app_config` cannot use `"owner"`.
  - `"adult"` — `memberRole === "adult"`.
  - `"privileged"` — a member of a `privileged_groups` entry covering `"select"`
    (for `inherit_visibility`, the **parent** table's groups). Masking is a read
    concept, so select privilege is what counts. Requires such a group to be set.
- **Adults get no implicit bypass.** `visible_to: ["owner"]` hides the column from
  adults too — only the row owner (and trusted hub endpoints) see it. List
  `["owner", "adult"]` if adults should also see it.
- The masked value is returned as `null` to non-authorized callers, applied to the
  result rows after decryption. The column may stay encrypted at rest.
- **For a non-authorized caller, a masked column may appear only as a plain
  selected column** (`SELECT secret_word …` or `SELECT *`). Referencing it in
  `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, a function/expression
  (`length(secret_word)`), a `JOIN`, a `UNION`, or the right-hand side of an
  `UPDATE ... SET` is rejected with 403 — those would leak the value through a
  comparison or ordering oracle. **Assigning** the column (`INSERT`,
  `UPDATE ... SET secret_word = ?`) is allowed, so the owner can still write it.
- You cannot mask a policy-structural column (the owner column, `visibility_column`,
  a `max_per_member` scope column, `frozen_when.status_column`, etc.) — manifest
  validation rejects it, because the hub itself compares those columns.
- This masks **reads**; it does not make the column immutable. For **write** control
  of a column, use `column_write_acls` (below).

#### `column_write_acls` — per-column write governance (cross-kind modifier)

The write-side counterpart of `column_read_acls`, valid on **every** policy kind.
Restricts who may write individual columns on `INSERT`/`UPDATE`:

```json
"column_write_acls": {
  "status":    { "writable_by": ["adult"] },
  "locked_at": { "writable_by": [], "actions": ["update"] },
  "signed":    { "writable_by": ["owner"], "owner_column": "supervisor_id" }
}
```

- Each key is a column. `writable_by` lists the principals allowed to write it:
  - `"adult"` — `memberRole === "adult"` (capability).
  - `"privileged"` — a `privileged_groups` entry covering the governed write
    action(s) (`insert`/`update`); manifest validation requires such a group.
  - `"owner"` — the row owner. **Fail-closed**: on `INSERT` the row's owner value
    must equal the caller; on `UPDATE` the hub appends `AND <owner_column> = <caller>`
    so the write only lands on the caller's own rows. Defaults to the policy's owner
    column; set `owner_column` to point at a different column (e.g. one participant's
    slot), which is how each party writes only its own agreement flag.
- **Empty `writable_by: []` forbids the write** — the column is immutable for that
  action (or endpoint-only, since trusted hub endpoints bypass row policies). Pair
  with `actions` to make a column *set-once* (`"actions": ["update"]` → writable on
  insert, frozen after) or *set-later-only* (`"actions": ["insert"]` → blocked at
  creation, written later).
- `actions` (optional, default `["insert","update"]`) scopes the ACL to a subset of
  write actions. A caller who satisfies no listed principal gets a 403.
- A single `UPDATE` that writes two owner-columns bound to different owners is
  rejected — a member can only be one owner.

#### `retain_days` — hub-managed automatic expiry (cross-kind modifier)

Declares a retention window for one table; the hub's **daily maintenance runner**
deletes rows whose `timestamp_column` is older than `default` days. App SQL is
never granted this power — the bounded delete runs as trusted code, so a member
cannot use it to purge rows early. Valid on any policy kind.

```json
"retain_days": {
  "default": 90,
  "timestamp_column": "created_at",
  "id_column": "id",
  "override_key": "messages",
  "dependent_tables": [
    { "table": "message_reactions", "foreign_key": "message_id" }
  ]
}
```

- `default` — positive integer number of days to keep a row after
  `timestamp_column`.
- `timestamp_column` — the plaintext date/datetime column the age is measured
  from (`created_at` and other `_at` columns are already plaintext; a custom
  column must be listed in `db_plaintext_columns`).
- `id_column` (optional, default `"id"`) — the primary key used to page the
  delete.
- `override_key` (optional) — a shared name so several tables (or an admin
  setting) resolve to one retention value; all entries under one key must use the
  same `default`.
- `dependent_tables` (optional) — child rows to remove **before** an expired
  parent row, for legacy schemas that can't add `ON DELETE CASCADE` in an
  additive migration. Each is `{ table, foreign_key }` and must itself have a row
  policy.

Use it for ephemeral logs, chat history, location pings, and any table with a
"keep N days" policy. It affects only deletion timing — reads/writes still obey
the base policy kind.

#### `owner_only_with_fk_check` — like `owner_only`, but the row references another owned row

```json
{
  "kind": "owner_only_with_fk_check",
  "member_column": "member_id",
  "fk_column": "bank_id",
  "fk_table": "piggy_banks",
  "fk_member_column": "member_id"
}
```

Same as `owner_only`, plus on `INSERT`/`UPDATE` the hub verifies the
referenced `fk_table` row (by `fk_column` -> `fk_table.id`) is owned by the
same member via `fk_table.fk_member_column` — prevents a child from writing
a transaction against another member's bank by guessing its id.

#### `owner_or_visibility` — a row is owned by one member but may be shared

```json
{
  "kind": "owner_or_visibility",
  "member_column": "owner_id",
  "visibility_column": "visibility",
  "everyone_values": ["everyone"],
  "adult_values": ["adults", "everyone"],
  "write_owner_only": false,
  "privileged_groups": [{ "settings_table": "settings", "settings_key": "committee_group_id" }],
  "privileged_values": ["private"]
}
```

- `SELECT`: a row is visible if `member_column = <caller>` OR
  `visibility_column` is in `everyone_values` (plus `adult_values` if the
  caller is an adult, plus `privileged_values` if the caller is privileged
  for `select` via `privileged_groups`).
- `UPDATE`/`DELETE`: privileged callers (an entry covering the statement's
  action) can always write any row. Adults can write any row **unless**
  `write_owner_only: true`, in which case adults (like everyone else) are
  restricted to `member_column = <caller>`.
- `INSERT`: always forces `member_column` to the caller — you own what you create.
- Add `"insert_privileged_only": true` (requires a `privileged_groups` entry covering `"insert"`) to block `INSERT` for everyone except the privileged group — returns 403 for all other callers regardless of adult status. The column is still forced to the caller for privileged inserts. SELECT/UPDATE/DELETE are unaffected by this flag.
- Add `"write_visibility_scoped": true` for **writes that follow reads**: a
  caller may `UPDATE`/`DELETE` exactly the rows they can `SEE` (their own, plus
  rows whose `visibility_column` grants them read). This supersedes both
  `write_owner_only` and the default "any adult writes any row" — a member who
  cannot see a row can no longer blind-write or blind-delete it either.
  Privileged members (entry covering the write action) still write any row —
  a select-only entry instead widens the rows such a member may co-edit,
  since writes follow reads; non-adults
  remain bound by `delete_adult_only` (and any `column_write_acls`). Use it for
  **collaboratively-edited, audience-scoped** tables — a group/committee working
  doc, a shared binder — where the whole visible audience co-edits but outsiders
  must not touch rows they can't even see. This is the only way to enforce
  "the audience co-edits, others can't write" without routing writes through an
  endpoint. (Note the fail-safe: if you flip an app-wide setting that widens a
  row's audience, a non-privileged caller who can't yet see a row can't re-key
  it — the failure is over-restrictive, never a disclosure.) `in-case-of-emergency`
  is the reference (`created_by`/`visibility` in `adults`/`group`, all adults or a
  configured group co-edit).

Example: streaks `streaks` (`owner_id`/`visibility` in `private`/`adults`/`everyone`); architectural-review `requests` (`submitted_by`/`visibility` in `public`/`private`, with the committee group privileged to see `private` requests and decide on any request); document-library `documents` (`created_by`/`visibility`, everyone reads, only board group may insert); in-case-of-emergency `entries` (`write_visibility_scoped` — the visible audience co-edits, outsiders can't write).

#### `adult_only` — entire table restricted to adults

```json
{ "kind": "adult_only" }
```

Every operation throws `403` for non-adult callers; adults are unrestricted.
Use for tables with no per-row ownership at all (e.g. shared account
balances, fund snapshots).

#### `couple_scoped` — visible/writable by a member and their configured partner

```json
{
  "kind": "couple_scoped",
  "self_column": "author_id",
  "participant_columns": ["author_id", "recipient_id"],
  "partner_table": "partner_config",
  "partner_member_column": "member_id",
  "partner_id_column": "partner_id"
}
```

A row is visible/writable if any of `participant_columns` equals the
caller's id or their configured partner's id (looked up from
`partner_table`). `INSERT` forces `self_column` to the caller and rejects
any `participant_columns` value that isn't the caller or their partner.
Assumes exactly one partner per member — not for group/throuple apps.

#### `party_scoped` — visible/writable by any of an arbitrary set of named members

```json
{
  "kind": "party_scoped",
  "member_columns": ["borrower_id", "lender_id"],
  "self_column": "borrower_id"
}
```

Like `couple_scoped` but for **N named participants with no configured partner
relationship** — borrow requests, expense splits, marketplace deals. A row is
visible/writable if the caller's id appears in **any** of `member_columns`.
`self_column` (optional) is forced to the caller on `INSERT`. Set
`"endpoint_writes_only": true` to block app-originated writes while keeping the
party-scoped read filter (writes then go through a trusted hub workflow).

Note: `party_scoped` limits *which rows* each party may write, but any party can
still write *any column* on a shared row. When each participant must consent
without being able to forge another's flag, put the consent state in a separate
`endpoint_only` table and use the `agreements` mechanism (see below), or gate the
columns with `column_write_acls` `owner_column`.

#### `channel_scoped` — visibility follows per-channel membership

For chat/forum-style rows whose audience is a channel's membership (all-household,
a role, or an explicit member list):

```json
{
  "kind": "channel_scoped",
  "channels_table": "channels",
  "channel_id_column": "channel_id",
  "membership_type_column": "membership_type",
  "membership_roles_column": "membership_roles",
  "membership_table": "channel_members",
  "membership_channel_column": "channel_id",
  "membership_member_column": "member_id",
  "self_column": "author_id"
}
```

- A row (e.g. a message) is visible/writable iff the caller is a member of the
  channel it references (`channel_id_column` → `channels_table.id`). Channel
  membership is one of: `all_value` (whole household), `role_value` (a role named
  in `membership_roles_column`), or an explicit row in `membership_table`
  (`group_value`). `all_value`/`role_value` default to `"all"`/`"role"`.
- `membership_type_column` and `membership_roles_column` must be plaintext
  (list them in `db_plaintext_columns`) — the hub compares them.
- `self_column` (optional) is forced to the caller on `INSERT`, so a member can't
  post as someone else.
- `group-channels` is the reference implementation; the parallel
  `subscription_notify` `eligibility` block mirrors this shape for follower
  fan-out.

#### `inherit_visibility` — a child row's access follows its parent row

For tables with no `member_id`/`visibility` of their own (votes, comments,
activity logs, streak check-offs) whose access should mirror a parent row
they reference via foreign key:

```json
{
  "kind": "inherit_visibility",
  "fk_column": "request_id",
  "parent_table": "requests",
  "writer_column": "voter_id"
}
```

- `parent_table` (unprefixed) must itself have an `owner_only`,
  `owner_only_with_fk_check`, or `owner_or_visibility` row policy — its
  visibility/ownership rules (and `privileged_groups`/`privileged_values`
  if present, evaluated per the child statement's action) are reused for the
  child table.
- `SELECT`: a child row is visible iff its parent row (matched via
  `fk_column = parent.id`) is visible to the caller.
- `INSERT`: forces `writer_column` to the caller, and rejects the insert
  (`403`) if the referenced parent row isn't visible to the caller (e.g.
  can't vote/comment/log on something you can't see).
- Add `"insert_only_by_parent_column_member": "current_turn_member_id"` for
  turn-scoped child rows: the referenced parent row must have that member-id
  column equal to the caller before any app-originated `INSERT` is accepted.
  This is stricter than visibility and is enforced even for adults/privileged
  callers, so a player cannot insert a move/question/guess when it is not their
  turn by POSTing raw SQL to `/api/db`.
- `UPDATE`/`DELETE`: privileged callers (per the parent policy's
  `privileged_groups`/adult-bypass, for that action) are unrestricted (e.g.
  cascade-delete when the parent is deleted); everyone else is restricted to
  rows where `writer_column = <caller>`.
- Add `"insert_privileged_only": true` to block `INSERT` for everyone except
  the privileged group inherited from the parent policy's `privileged_groups`
  (entries covering `"insert"`). Returns 403 for all other callers. Useful when
  only a designated group should be able to create child rows (e.g. only the
  board uploads document versions).

Examples: architectural-review `votes`/`comments` inherit from `requests`;
officer-elections-style "any visible member can check off a group streak"
(streaks `streak_logs` inherits from `streaks`); violation-tracking
`activity` inherits from `violations` (homeowners see/log activity only on
their own violations; board members see/log on any violation); document-library
`document_versions` inherits from `documents` with `insert_privileged_only: true`
(only the board may upload new versions).

Turn-based game pattern: put `current_turn_member_id` on the parent game/round
table, make moves/questions/guesses an `inherit_visibility` child table, and set
`insert_only_by_parent_column_member: "current_turn_member_id"` on that child
policy. This covers async turn rotation for Word Game / 20 Questions / Draw &
Guess-style apps without a bespoke server endpoint per game. Pair it with
`max_per_member` when the child table also needs one attributed row per round
or turn.

#### `sealed_until` — owners see their response until the parent closes, then everyone sees

Use `sealed_until` for attributed, non-anonymous child rows that should be hidden
from non-owners until a parent row reaches a release state. It is the N-party
version of "mutual reveal": each member can see and edit their own response while
the round/session is open; once the parent says `status = "closed"`, every member
can read all responses.

```json
{
  "kind": "sealed_until",
  "fk_column": "round_id",
  "parent_table": "rounds",
  "writer_column": "member_id",
  "parent_status_column": "status",
  "visible_parent_status_values": ["closed"],
  "max_per_member": {
    "member_column": "member_id",
    "scope_columns": ["round_id"],
    "limit": 1
  },
  "frozen_when": {
    "status_column": "status",
    "locked_values": ["closed"]
  }
}
```

- `SELECT`: the caller sees rows where `writer_column = <caller>`, plus any rows
  whose parent row (matched by `fk_column = parent.id`) has
  `parent_status_column` in `visible_parent_status_values`.
- `INSERT`: forces `writer_column` to the caller.
- `UPDATE`/`DELETE`: remains writer-scoped. Add `frozen_when` so nobody can edit
  or delete responses after the parent round closes.
- `parent_status_column` must be plaintext. `status` is built in; custom release
  columns such as `round_state` must be listed in `db_plaintext_columns`.
- Add `"visible_after_parent_column": "reveal_date"` for a **clock-based reveal**:
  a plaintext ISO date/datetime column on the parent releases all rows once its
  value is at or before the hub's current time, OR'd with the status-based release
  above. The hub enforces the clock — the app cannot make a still-sealed capsule
  open early, and reveal happens even if no one clicks a Reveal button. A plain
  `_date` column ("2026-07-09") opens from the start of that UTC day; a datetime
  column releases at the instant it names. Use it for time capsules and scheduled
  reveals; leave it off for reveals driven purely by a status change. Mirror it in
  any client "is this released?" gate (compare `reveal_date <= new Date().toISOString()`)
  so the UI matches what the hub will actually return. `time-capsule` is the
  reference implementation.
- Pair with `max_per_member` for "one answer/guess/bid per member per round."
  This is still attributed data, so do not use it for anonymous surveys or secret
  ballots; use `anonymous_responses` / `anonymous_ballot` when the response row
  must not identify the member.

Examples: Family Trivia answers, Word Game guesses, 20 Questions answers, Draw &
Guess submissions, and sealed HOA vendor bids. Parent rows are usually
`adult_writable`, `owner_or_visibility`, or another policy appropriate to who may
create/close rounds. If the app also has turn-scoped moves/questions, use
`inherit_visibility` with `insert_only_by_parent_column_member` for those action
rows and `sealed_until` for the final per-member responses.

### Choosing a policy kind

| Your table looks like... | Use |
|---|---|
| Table written only by a trusted hub endpoint; result access controlled separately | `endpoint_only` with appropriate `read` |
| Shared content adults manage, everyone reads (chores, polls, surveys) | `adult_writable` |
| Same, but non-adults should only read their own rows | `adult_writable` with `member_read_column` |
| Settings row that names a privileged group (board_group_id, committee_group_id) | `app_config` |
| One row per member, only that member (and maybe adults) should see it | `owner_only` |
| One attributed submission per member per event/round/title/slot | Any suitable row policy plus `max_per_member` |
| Same, but writes must go through a hub endpoint (e.g. vote receipts) | `owner_only` with `endpoint_writes_only: true` |
| Like the above, but the row references another owned row (e.g. a transaction against a bank) | `owner_only_with_fk_check` |
| A row can be private, shared with adults, or shared with everyone | `owner_or_visibility` |
| The row is readable by all, but one column (secret word, valuation) only by the owner/adults/a group | Any owner-bearing kind plus `column_read_acls` |
| The visible audience (all adults, or a configured group) should co-edit rows, but no one may write a row they can't see | `owner_or_visibility` with `write_visibility_scoped: true` |
| Table-wide, adults-only data (account balances, fund totals) | `adult_only` |
| Shared between exactly two partnered members | `couple_scoped` |
| Shared among an arbitrary set of named members (borrow request, expense split) | `party_scoped` |
| Rows whose audience is a chat/forum channel's membership | `channel_scoped` |
| Cap the total rows a table may hold (incl. external submissions) | any kind plus `max_rows` |
| Auto-expire rows after N days (ephemeral logs, chat history, location pings) | any kind plus `retain_days` |
| Votes/comments/logs/check-offs whose visibility should match a parent record | `inherit_visibility` |
| Turn-based child rows where only the current player may INSERT (moves, questions, guesses) | `inherit_visibility` with `insert_only_by_parent_column_member: "current_turn_member_id"` |
| Attributed responses hidden from everyone except the owner until the parent closes | `sealed_until` with `visible_parent_status_values: ["closed"]`; usually add `max_per_member` and `frozen_when` |
| Sealed entries that must open on a wall-clock date, hub-enforced (time capsule, scheduled reveal) | `sealed_until` with `visible_after_parent_column: "reveal_date"` |
| Anonymous data with no per-row ownership at all (e.g. cast ballots, raw anonymous responses) | `endpoint_only` with `read:"none"` — pair with a receipt table under `owner_only` + `adults_bypass:false` + `member_can_update:false` + `endpoint_writes_only:true`; use `anonymous_responses` or `anonymous_ballot` manifest mechanisms to write both atomically |
| Everyone can read, but only a specific group may INSERT (e.g. board-managed docs) | `owner_or_visibility` with `everyone_values`, `write_owner_only: true`, and `insert_privileged_only: true` |
| Child rows where only a privileged group may create them (e.g. document versions) | `inherit_visibility` with `insert_privileged_only: true` |

### `privileged_groups`

```json
"privileged_groups": [
  { "settings_table": "settings", "settings_key": "board_group_id" }
]
```

Grants unrestricted access to members of a hub group whose id is stored in
this app's own `settings_table` under `settings_key`. Requires your app to
have a `settings` table (key/value, like
`app_violation_tracking__settings`) and a settings UI where an admin/adult
picks a hub group (e.g. "Board", "Committee") to designate as privileged.
If the setting is unset, no one gets this bypass — only the
`adults_bypass`/`adult_values` rules apply.

Available on `owner_only`, `owner_only_with_fk_check`, and
`owner_or_visibility` (and inherited by `inherit_visibility` children from
their parent). Each entry may scope its privilege with `"actions"`, a
non-empty subset of `"select"`/`"insert"`/`"update"`/`"delete"`; omitting
`actions` grants all four. List multiple entries for per-role power — the
caller is privileged for a statement when they belong to **any** entry whose
actions cover that statement's kind:

```json
"privileged_groups": [
  { "settings_table": "settings", "settings_key": "treasurer_group_id", "actions": ["insert"] },
  { "settings_table": "settings", "settings_key": "secretary_group_id", "actions": ["update", "delete"] }
]
```

Rules to know:

- **Visibility follows `select`.** Anything that widens what a caller can
  *see* — `privileged_values`, `column_read_acls` `"privileged"`, the parent
  visibility used by `inherit_visibility`, and the row set writable under
  `write_visibility_scoped` (writes follow reads) — uses `"select"` privilege,
  never the write actions. An insert-only entry grants no extra read access.
- **Gate flags need coverage.** `insert_privileged_only` /
  `delete_privileged_only` require an entry covering that action;
  `write_privileged_only` requires coverage of `insert`, `update`, **and**
  `delete`. Otherwise the manifest is rejected (the flag would lock everyone
  out).
- **Legacy shape.** `"bypass_group_setting": { settings_table, settings_key }`
  is still accepted and is exactly equivalent to one `privileged_groups` entry
  with no `actions`. Declaring both on one policy is a manifest validation
  error — use `privileged_groups` in new apps.

### Verifying your row_policies

`node build.mjs` runs manifest validation, including `row_policies` — it
will catch invalid `kind`, missing required fields, bad identifiers, and
`inherit_visibility.parent_table` not having a compatible parent policy. It
also verifies `sealed_until.parent_status_column` is plaintext and that the
declared parent table has a row policy.
This catches schema mistakes before install, but does **not** test the
actual SQL rewriting — when in doubt, check
`packages/hub/__tests__/unit/cloudflare-row-policy.test.ts` in the hub repo
for worked examples per policy kind.

### Named AI queries (`ai_access`) obey the same row policies

Your `ai_access` named SQL — `db_exports` (queries), `db_mutations`, `db_inserts`,
`db_deletes` — runs through the **same** `row_policies` enforcement as `/api/db`.
An AI caller does **not** get to bypass a policy. This has practical consequences
for how you write those `.sql` files:

- **The caller must pass a `member_id`.** MCP tokens are household-scoped and carry
  no member identity, so the AI supplies `member_id` per call. A named query that
  touches an `owner_only`, `owner_or_visibility`, or `adult_only` table **returns
  403 ("Member identity required") when `member_id` is absent** — the same as a raw
  `/api/db` call with no session member. Write your named queries assuming a member
  is always provided, and document in the query's purpose which member's view it
  returns.
- **No JOINs or subqueries against a governed table.** The rewriter fails closed on
  governed tables referenced through a JOIN or a subquery/CTE. Keep each named query
  a single-table `SELECT` on the governed table; do lookups/labels in a second query
  or denormalize the label onto the row.
- **`column_read_acls` masking applies here too.** A `db_export` that selects a
  masked column returns `null` for that column unless the passed `member_id` is the
  owner (or an adult/privileged member per `visible_to`). Don't rely on a named
  query to read a secret column on behalf of a non-owner.
- **Named `INSERT`s into `owner_only` tables force the owner column to the caller.**
  Include the member column in the insert and expect the hub to stamp it to
  `member_id`; you cannot insert a row owned by someone else through a named insert.
- `adult_writable` "everyone-read" tables are the exception — their `db_exports`
  need no `member_id` (reads are open); only their writes require an adult.

## Atomic capacity claims — `slot_claims`

For sign-up sheets, shift claims, carpool seats, babysitting co-op coverage, amenity slots, and any "claim iff capacity remains" flow, use the `slot_claims` manifest mechanism instead of writing the claims table directly through `/api/db`.

**Why you can't do this with row_policies alone:** capacity is a cross-row invariant. A browser can read "2 seats left" and then race another browser before inserting; `max_per_member` can prevent duplicate claims by the same member, but it cannot atomically enforce `COUNT(claims) < slots.capacity`.

### How it works

Declare `slot_claims` in `manifest.json`. The hub injects `window.__CLAIM_URL`, `window.__RELEASE_URL`, and `window.__SWAP_URL`. The claim endpoint:

1. Resolves the caller's `member_id` from the session (cannot be spoofed)
2. Runs one atomic `INSERT ... SELECT` that inserts only if the slot exists, is open, capacity remains, and (optionally) the caller has not already claimed that slot
3. Returns `201 { success: true, claim_id }` on success
4. Returns `404` for a missing slot, or `409` with `reason: "slot_closed" | "slot_full" | "already_claimed"` when the guarded insert does not happen

Release deletes only the caller's own claim. Swap claims the destination slot first, then releases the source slot; if the destination is full or closed, the original claim is untouched. Because D1 exposes only single-statement writes here, swap is not a true transaction: the hub best-effort rolls back the new claim if the source release fails.

### Manifest config

```jsonc
{
  "storage": "db",
  "db_plaintext_columns": ["capacity", "note"],
  "row_policies": {
    "slot_claims": { "kind": "endpoint_only", "read": "everyone" }
  },
  "slot_claims": {
    "slot_table": "slots",
    "slot_id_column": "id",
    "capacity_column": "capacity",
    "slot_status_column": "status",
    "slot_open_values": ["open"],
    "claims_table": "slot_claims",
    "claim_id_column": "id",
    "slot_fk_column": "slot_id",
    "member_column": "member_id",
    "created_at_column": "created_at",
    "one_claim_per_member": true,
    "allow_release": true,
    "allowed_columns": ["note"],
    "max_text_lengths": { "note": 200 }
  }
}
```

- Table/column names are **unprefixed** in the manifest.
- The claims table must be `endpoint_only`; otherwise a member can bypass capacity by POSTing raw SQL to `/api/db`.
- `capacity_column`, `slot_status_column`, and every `allowed_columns` payload column must be plaintext. Built-ins like `id`, `status`, `created_at`, and `*_id` already are; custom columns like `capacity` or `note` must be listed in `db_plaintext_columns`.
- `slot_open_values` is required when `slot_status_column` is present.
- `allowed_columns` are optional app-defined payload columns on the claim row. The hub accepts only scalar JSON (`string`, `number`, `boolean`, `null`) and enforces `max_text_lengths`.

### Schema requirements

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS app_myapp__slots (
  id         TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  title      TEXT NOT NULL,
  capacity   INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK (capacity >= 0),
  status     TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'open',
  starts_at  TEXT,
  created_at TEXT NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS app_myapp__slot_claims (
  id         TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  slot_id    TEXT NOT NULL,
  member_id  TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TEXT NOT NULL,
  note       TEXT,
  FOREIGN KEY (slot_id) REFERENCES app_myapp__slots(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_slot_claims_slot
  ON app_myapp__slot_claims (slot_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_slot_claims_member
  ON app_myapp__slot_claims (member_id);
```

If `one_claim_per_member` is true, the endpoint enforces it. A unique index on `(slot_id, member_id)` is still fine as defense in depth, but do not rely on an index alone for capacity.

### Client helpers

```js
async function claimSlot(slotId, payload = {}) {
  const res = await fetch(window.__CLAIM_URL, {
    method: "POST",
    headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    body: JSON.stringify({ slot_id: slotId, ...payload }),
  });
  const json = await res.json();
  if (!res.ok || json.error) throw Object.assign(new Error(json.error || "Claim failed"), { response: res, json });
  return json; // { success: true, claim_id }
}

async function releaseSlot(slotId) {
  const res = await fetch(window.__RELEASE_URL, {
    method: "POST",
    headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    body: JSON.stringify({ slot_id: slotId }),
  });
  const json = await res.json();
  if (!res.ok || json.error) throw Object.assign(new Error(json.error || "Release failed"), { response: res, json });
  return json; // { success: true }
}

async function swapSlot(fromSlotId, toSlotId, payload = {}) {
  const res = await fetch(window.__SWAP_URL, {
    method: "POST",
    headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    body: JSON.stringify({ from_slot_id: fromSlotId, to_slot_id: toSlotId, ...payload }),
  });
  const json = await res.json();
  if (!res.ok || json.error) throw Object.assign(new Error(json.error || "Swap failed"), { response: res, json });
  return json; // { success: true, claim_id }
}
```

Handle `409` reasons explicitly in the UI: `slot_full` means someone else got the last spot, `already_claimed` means the caller already has a claim on that slot, and `slot_closed` means the slot's status is no longer claimable. After a successful claim/release/swap, patch local state optimistically or re-query just the affected slot and claim list.

## Anonymous submissions — `anonymous_responses`

For surveys, polls, and any "one submission per session per member" flow where the submitter's identity must optionally be hidden, use the `anonymous_responses` manifest mechanism instead of writing directly to `/api/db`.

**Why you can't do this with row_policies alone:** a client posting directly to `/api/db` can omit or forge its own `member_id`. The server needs to resolve identity and decide whether to store it.

### How it works

Declare `anonymous_responses` in `manifest.json`. The hub exposes `POST /run/{appId}/api/submit-response`, which:

1. Resolves the caller's `member_id` from the session (cannot be spoofed)
2. Checks the session table: rejects if status ≠ `session_open_value`
3. Checks the receipt table for a duplicate → 409 `already_responded` if found
4. Inserts the receipt row first (fail-safe: a partial failure always blocks retry)
5. Inserts one response row per answer, with `member_id` set or omitted based on anonymity

The hub injects `window.__SUBMIT_RESPONSE_URL` for apps that declare this field.

### Config

```json
{
  "anonymous_responses": {
    "receipt_table":              "response_receipts",
    "session_column":             "survey_id",
    "member_column":              "member_id",
    "created_at_column":          "created_at",
    "response_table":             "responses",
    "response_session_column":    "survey_id",
    "response_question_column":   "question_id",
    "response_member_column":     "member_id",
    "response_answer_column":     "answer",
    "response_id_column":         "id",
    "response_created_at_column": "created_at",
    "session_table":              "surveys",
    "session_id_column":          "id",
    "session_status_column":      "status",
    "session_open_value":         "open",
    "session_anonymous_column":   "anonymous"
  }
}
```

- Omit `response_member_column` → always anonymous (member_id never stored in response rows)
- Omit `session_anonymous_column` → same (no per-session toggle)
- Include both → hub reads the session's `anonymous` column at submission time; non-anonymous sessions store `member_id`, anonymous sessions strip it

### Schema requirements

```sql
-- Receipt table: one row per (session, member) — immutable proof of submission
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS app_myapp__response_receipts (
  survey_id  TEXT NOT NULL,
  member_id  TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TEXT NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (survey_id, member_id)
);

-- Response table: member_id nullable to support anonymous rows
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS app_myapp__responses (
  id          TEXT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
  survey_id   TEXT NOT NULL,
  question_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  member_id   TEXT,           -- NULL for anonymous submissions
  answer      TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at  TEXT NOT NULL
);

-- Partial unique index: one response per member per question for non-anonymous;
-- NULL member_id rows are unconstrained (SQLite treats each NULL as distinct)
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS responses_member_unique
  ON app_myapp__responses (survey_id, question_id, member_id)
  WHERE member_id IS NOT NULL;
```

Receipt table row policy — immutable and invisible to everyone including adults, writes blocked except through the hub endpoint:

```json
"response_receipts": {
  "kind": "owner_only",
  "member_column": "member_id",
  "adults_bypass": false,
  "member_can_update": false,
  "endpoint_writes_only": true
}
```

Response table — use `endpoint_only` so app-originated writes are rejected and reads are controlled:

```json
"responses": { "kind": "endpoint_only", "read": "none" }
```

`read: "none"` keeps raw responses hidden until a trusted hub endpoint releases them (e.g. `/api/response-results` after session closure). Use `read: "everyone"` or `read: "adult"` if attributed responses should be readable directly once the session closes. Never leave the response table without a row policy — without it any member can INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE response rows via `/api/db`.

### Calling the endpoint

```js
const SUBMIT_RESPONSE = window.__SUBMIT_RESPONSE_URL ?? "";

const res = await fetch(SUBMIT_RESPONSE, {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    session_id: survey.id,
    responses: questions.map(q => ({
      question_id: q.id,   // only if response_question_column is declared
      answer: answers[q.id],
    })),
  }),
});
if (res.status === 409) { /* already submitted */ }
```

### Critical: "has responded" queries must use the receipt table

For anonymous submissions, `member_id` is NULL in the response table — `COUNT(DISTINCT member_id)` on it always returns 0. Use the receipt table for all response-count and "have I responded" checks, including list views, widgets, and AI export SQL files:

```sql
-- ✅ Correct — works for both anonymous and non-anonymous sessions
EXISTS(
  SELECT 1 FROM app_myapp__response_receipts rr
  WHERE rr.survey_id = s.id AND rr.member_id = ?
) AS i_responded

-- ❌ Wrong — always 0 for anonymous sessions
EXISTS(
  SELECT 1 FROM app_myapp__responses r
  WHERE r.survey_id = s.id AND r.member_id = ?
) AS i_responded
```

## Multi-party agreements — `agreements`

For any flow where two or more named participants must each consent before a record is "locked" (borrow requests, family contracts, parental agreements, shared commitments), use the `agreements` manifest mechanism instead of storing agreement flags in a `party_scoped` table.

**Why prefer the `agreements` mechanism:** it also provides atomic locking, snapshot-freezing of agreed values, and bootstrap-from-source — server-side logic a row policy can't express. If all you need is *forgery prevention* (each party may only write its own flag), you can instead keep a single governed table and add `column_write_acls` giving each flag column `{ "writable_by": ["owner"], "owner_column": "<that party's member column>" }` — the hub then appends a per-party owner guard so a member cannot forge their counterpart's consent via `/api/db`. Reach for the `agreements` endpoint when you also need the locking/snapshot semantics below.

### How it works

Declare `agreements` in `manifest.json`. The hub exposes `POST /run/{appId}/api/agree`, which:

1. Resolves the caller's `member_id` from the session (cannot be spoofed)
2. Reads the agreement row; if it doesn't exist and `init_from_table` is configured, bootstraps it by copying `init_columns` from the source table
3. Verifies the caller is a participant (their id must be in one of the `participant_columns`)
4. Sets only the caller's own flag (`agreement_columns[callerId]`) to `agreed` (true) or `0` (false)
5. If all flags are now true, sets `status_column` to `locked_value` and records `locked_at`

### Table layout

Split into two tables — item details in a `party_scoped` table, agreement state in a separate `endpoint_only` table:

```sql
-- Item details: parties can read/edit terms
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS app_myapp__requests (
  id          TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  borrower_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  lender_id   TEXT NOT NULL,
  item_name   TEXT NOT NULL,
  -- ... other item-detail columns ...
  status      TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending',  -- 'pending' | 'cancelled' | 'returned'
  created_at  TEXT NOT NULL,
  updated_at  TEXT NOT NULL
);

-- Agreement state: only api/agree may write
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS app_myapp__request_agreements (
  id              TEXT PRIMARY KEY,  -- same id as requests
  borrower_id     TEXT NOT NULL,     -- copied from requests on init
  lender_id       TEXT NOT NULL,
  borrower_agreed INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  lender_agreed   INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  status          TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending',  -- 'pending' | 'locked'
  locked_at       TEXT,
  updated_at      TEXT NOT NULL
);
```

### Manifest config

```json
{
  "row_policies": {
    "requests": {
      "kind": "party_scoped",
      "member_columns": ["borrower_id", "lender_id"],
      "self_column": "borrower_id"
    },
    "request_agreements": {
      "kind": "endpoint_only",
      "read": "everyone"
    }
  },
  "agreements": {
    "request_agreements": {
      "participant_columns": ["borrower_id", "lender_id"],
      "agreement_columns": { "borrower_id": "borrower_agreed", "lender_id": "lender_agreed" },
      "status_column": "status",
      "pending_value": "pending",
      "locked_value": "locked",
      "locked_at_column": "locked_at",
      "updated_at_column": "updated_at",
      "init_from_table": "requests",
      "init_columns": ["borrower_id", "lender_id"]
    }
  }
}
```

- `participant_columns` — columns whose values name the valid participants; hub rejects callers not in this set
- `agreement_columns` — maps each participant column name to the boolean flag column that participant controls
- `init_from_table` + `init_columns` — when the agreement row doesn't exist yet, the hub INSERTs it by copying these columns from the named table (same `id`). Required when the agreement table is `endpoint_only` and the client cannot INSERT into it directly.
- `locked_at_column` / `updated_at_column` — optional; hub sets them server-side

### Client flow

```js
// After inserting into the party_scoped table:
await db(`INSERT INTO app_myapp__requests (...) VALUES (...)`, [...]);
// Trigger init_from_table + set caller's own flag:
await fetch(`/run/${APP_ID}/api/agree`, {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({ table: "request_agreements", id, agreed: true }),
});

// When the other party agrees:
await fetch(`/run/${APP_ID}/api/agree`, {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({ table: "request_agreements", id: reqId, agreed: true }),
});
// Hub sets both flags; if both true, sets status='locked', locked_at=now

// When a party edits terms (reset their agreement; other party must re-agree):
await db(`UPDATE app_myapp__requests SET item_name=?, updated_at=? WHERE id=?`, [...]);
await fetch(`/run/${APP_ID}/api/agree`, { ..., body: JSON.stringify({ table: "request_agreements", id: reqId, agreed: false }) });
await fetch(`/run/${APP_ID}/api/agree`, { ..., body: JSON.stringify({ table: "request_agreements", id: reqId, agreed: true }) });
```

### Reading effective status

JOIN the two tables and derive `status` via CASE — the party_scoped table's `status` tracks terminal states (cancelled, returned), while the agreement table tracks the in-progress lock:

```sql
SELECT
  r.*,
  COALESCE(ra.borrower_agreed, 0) AS borrower_agreed,
  COALESCE(ra.lender_agreed, 0)   AS lender_agreed,
  CASE
    WHEN r.status IN ('cancelled', 'returned') THEN r.status
    WHEN ra.status = 'locked'                  THEN 'locked'
    ELSE 'pending'
  END AS status,
  ra.locked_at
FROM app_myapp__requests r
LEFT JOIN app_myapp__request_agreements ra ON ra.id = r.id
WHERE (r.borrower_id = ? OR r.lender_id = ?)
```

Reference implementation: `borrowing` app (`migrations/002_agreement_state.sql`, `manifest.json` `agreements` block, `src/index.html` `loadRequests`/`createRequest`/`updateRequest`/`agreeOnServer`).

## Append-only records — `append_only_records`

For immutable history rows, receipts, predictions, audit notes, and other "add a new record, never edit/delete it" data, use `append_only_records` instead of writing the table directly through `/api/db`.

The hub exposes `POST /run/{appId}/api/append-record/{name}` and injects `window.__APPEND_RECORD_URL` when the app declares the manifest field. The endpoint:

- accepts only whitelisted columns
- derives the row id, writer member id, and timestamp server-side
- optionally verifies a parent row exists
- optionally blocks appends when the parent is in a closed status
- enforces string length and enum allowlists
- inserts while bypassing the table's `endpoint_only` write block

Pair each append-only target table with either `row_policies.{table}.kind = "endpoint_only"` or an existing read policy that supports `"endpoint_writes_only": true` so direct app SQL cannot `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` rows. Use `endpoint_only` for household-readable logs; use `endpoint_writes_only` on policies like `owner_only`, `adult_writable`, or `inherit_visibility` when reads still need owner/private/inherited filtering.

```jsonc
{
  "row_policies": {
    "notes": { "kind": "endpoint_only", "read": "everyone" }
  },
  "append_only_records": {
    "notes": {
      "table": "notes",
      "parent_table": "items",
      "parent_fk_column": "item_id",
      "parent_status_column": "status",
      "parent_blocked_status_values": ["closed", "voided"],
      "allowed_columns": ["item_id", "body", "kind"],
      "writer_column": "created_by",
      "created_at_column": "created_at",
      "write_acl": {
        "require_role": "adult"
      },
      "allowed_values": {
        "kind": ["note", "receipt"]
      },
      "max_text_lengths": {
        "body": 2000,
        "kind": 20
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```js
async function appendRecord(name, data) {
  const res = await fetch(`${window.__APPEND_RECORD_URL}/${encodeURIComponent(name)}`, {
    method: "POST",
    headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    body: JSON.stringify(data),
  });
  const json = await res.json();
  if (!res.ok || json.error) throw new Error(json.error || "Append failed");
  return json; // { success: true, id, created_at? }
}

await appendRecord("notes", {
  item_id: itemId,
  kind: "receipt",
  body: "Screenshot saved before the decision changed.",
});
```

Use this for immutable children only. It does not enforce multi-party consent or state-machine decisions; use `agreements`, a more specific generic endpoint, or a new reusable protocol for those.

`write_acl` is optional. Use `"require_role": "adult"` for adult-only appends, or `"require_group_setting": { "settings_table": "settings", "settings_key": "committee_group_id" }` when only members of a configured Hub group may append. Household admins bypass group membership checks.

## Security pitfalls

### Client gates must mirror server policy

A helper like `canManage(item, me)` that returns `true` for the item's `created_by` regardless of role will show action buttons to non-adult creators. When they click, the `adult_writable` policy blocks the write with a silent 403 — misleading UX. The client gate should match the server policy exactly:

```js
// ❌ Wrong — shows controls to a non-adult creator
function canManage(item, me) {
  return item.created_by === me.id || isAdult(me);
}

// ✅ Correct — mirrors adult_writable policy
function canManage(item, me) {
  return !!me && isAdult(me);
}
```

#### Privileged-group gates: no "all adults" fallback when unconfigured

The same trap bites harder for `insert_privileged_only` / `write_privileged_only`
tables gated by `privileged_groups` (board/committee group). The hub treats a
member as privileged **only** when the group is configured, still exists, and the
member is in it — there is **no adult fallback** when the setting is unset or
points at a deleted group (`privileged_groups`: *"If the setting is unset, no
one gets this bypass"*). A client gate that returns `true` for adults when no
group is configured shows write UI the hub then 403s on every INSERT:

```js
// ❌ Wrong — "all adults are board until a group is picked". The hub rejects
//    every privileged INSERT while the group is unset, so adults see add/upload
//    buttons that silently fail.
function isBoard(me, groups, boardGroupId) {
  if (!isAdult(me)) return false;
  if (!boardGroupId) return true;                 // ← divergence from the hub
  const g = groups.find(g => g.id === boardGroupId);
  return g ? g.memberIds.includes(me.id) : true;  // ← dangling group also wrong
}

// ✅ Correct — mirrors the hub's memberInAppGroupSetting exactly.
function isBoard(me, groups, boardGroupId) {
  if (!isAdult(me) || !boardGroupId) return false;
  const g = groups.find(g => g.id === boardGroupId);
  return !!g && g.memberIds.includes(me.id);
}
```

Two consequences to handle in the UI when no group is configured: (1) hide the
privileged write controls and show a "an admin must configure the … group"
notice; (2) keep the group-selection settings reachable by a **hub admin**
(`window.__IS_ADMIN`), not gated behind the privileged role itself — otherwise no
one can ever appoint the first group (bootstrap deadlock).

**Test it.** Every gate fronting a privileged table must satisfy the shared
contract in `__tests__/helpers/privileged-gate.mjs` — call
`testPrivilegedGateContract` from your `logic.test.mjs`. It asserts the gate
returns `false` for the unconfigured and dangling-group cases, which is exactly
the divergence that shipped broken in document-library / amenity-reservations /
architectural-review (fixed 2026-06-28). A single-sided unit test that asserts
the *wrong* contract will pass while the app is broken — the helper pins the
client gate to the hub's actual behavior.

### `publishes` / `alert_on` require an actual endpoint call

Declaring these fields in `manifest.json` does not cause events to be emitted — your code must call the events endpoint after the action. A manifest with `publishes: ["survey.closed"]` but no `publishEvent` call after the status UPDATE means the integration is silently non-functional.

## Column encryption and `db_plaintext_columns`

The hub encrypts most string columns at rest before writing them to the database. This protects sensitive user content (names, notes, titles) if the underlying storage is ever compromised.

### What is already plaintext (never encrypted)

The hub skips encryption automatically for:

- Columns whose name ends in `_id` — foreign keys and member references
- Columns whose name ends in `_at` — timestamps (`created_at`, `updated_at`, etc.)
- Columns whose name ends in `_by` — actor columns (`created_by`, `done_by`)
- A fixed set of well-known columns: `id`, `household_id`, `completed`, `all_day`, `status`, `type`, `category`, `week`, `emoji`, `icon`, `position`, `sort_order`, `pinned`, `key`, `version`

These columns can be safely used in `WHERE` filters and `ORDER BY` clauses in SQL.

### The problem with encrypted columns

Columns that fall outside the list above are stored as ciphertext. That means:

- `WHERE my_col = ?` will never match — the param is plaintext but the stored value is ciphertext
- `ORDER BY my_col` produces an arbitrary order, not the string order you expect
- `CASE my_col WHEN 'breakfast' THEN 1 ...` never matches any branch

If your app has enum or date columns you need to filter or sort on in SQL, declare them as plaintext.

### `db_plaintext_columns`

Add this field to `manifest.json` to opt specific columns out of encryption for your app:

```json
{
  "storage": "db",
  "db_plaintext_columns": ["slot", "plan_date"]
}
```

Column names are matched case-insensitively. The list is app-scoped — it does not affect other apps that happen to have columns with the same name.

**When to use it:**

- Fixed enum columns used in `WHERE` or `ORDER BY` (e.g. `slot`, `status` if your app's `status` values differ from the global `status` skip)
- Date columns that don't end in `_at` (e.g. `plan_date`, `due_date`, `birth_date`) — these are never sensitive and must be comparable in SQL
- Any column you need to compare against a literal value in SQL

**When not to use it:**

- Free-text fields entered by the user (names, notes, titles, messages) — these should remain encrypted
- Columns that are only ever read back whole and displayed, never filtered or sorted

### `db_encryption`

Use this manifest field only when the app's own D1 data does not need app-layer encryption at all:

```json
{
  "storage": "db",
  "db_encryption": "off"
}
```

Omitting the field, or setting it to `"default"`, keeps the normal encrypt-on-write behavior. Setting `"off"` stores app-owned D1 values as plaintext; D1 is still encrypted at rest by Cloudflare, but raw D1 rows are readable to anyone with direct DB access. Use this for low-sensitivity apps where SQL filtering, sorting, indexes, and debugging matter more than app-layer confidentiality. Do not use it for messages, locations, health, finance, ballots, relationship data, documents metadata, or other private household content.

Prefer `db_plaintext_columns` when only a few enum/date/lookup columns need to be queryable. Prefer `db_encryption: "off"` only when the entire app database is intentionally non-sensitive.

**Backward compatibility:** Rows inserted before a column was added to `db_plaintext_columns` have their value stored encrypted. The hub decrypts them correctly on read (it checks each value before decrypting), so old and new rows coexist safely. SQL-level filters and ordering will only work for rows inserted after the column was declared plaintext.

## AI access (MCP)

Apps are **invisible to AI clients by default**. Opt in explicitly — this is intentional: private apps (couples apps, therapy notes, etc.) should never appear in AI tool listings.

Add `ai_access` to your manifest to enable MCP access:

```json
{
  "ai_access": {
    "allowed": true,
    "mode": "read"
  }
}
```

### Field reference

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `allowed` | boolean | `false` | Master switch. Must be `true` for any MCP access. |
| `mode` | `"read"` \| `"read_write"` | `"read"` | `"read"` allows `get_app_data` only. `"read_write"` also allows `set_app_data`. |
| `db_exports` | `string[]` | `[]` | Named SELECT queries exposed via `query_app_db`. DB-storage apps only. |
| `db_mutations` | `string[]` | `[]` | Named UPDATE mutations exposed via `mutate_app_db`. UPDATE-only, no INSERT or DELETE. DB-storage apps only. |
| `db_inserts` | `string[]` | `[]` | Named INSERT operations exposed via `insert_app_db`. Each requires a JSON Schema file for param validation. DB-storage apps only. |
| `requires_admin_approval` | boolean | `false` | If true, the hub admin must explicitly grant AI access after install. |

### KV apps — reading and writing via MCP

With `allowed: true` and `mode: "read"`, an AI client can read any key from your app's KV store via the `get_app_data` tool. With `mode: "read_write"`, it can also write via `set_app_data`.

```json
{
  "ai_access": {
    "allowed": true,
    "mode": "read_write"
  }
}
```

KV access goes through the normal MCP tool layer — no additional app-side work needed.

### DB apps — named query exports

DB-storage apps cannot be queried with raw SQL via MCP. Instead, declare named SELECT queries in `ai_access.db_exports` and put the SQL files in `src/queries/`:

```json
{
  "storage": "db",
  "ai_access": {
    "allowed": true,
    "mode": "read",
    "db_exports": ["open_tasks", "overdue_tasks", "task_summary"]
  }
}
```

Each name maps to `src/queries/{name}.sql`. The build script includes everything under `src/` in the bundle, so these files are automatically packaged and served.

**Query file conventions:**

- Files must be `SELECT` or `WITH ... SELECT` statements — the hub rejects anything else
- Always filter by `household_id` explicitly — do not rely on default values alone:
  ```sql
  WHERE household_id = current_setting('app.household_id', true)::uuid
  ```
- Include `LIMIT` to bound result size
- The query runs under the `hub_app_executor` Postgres role with `search_path` set to your app's schema — unqualified table names resolve to your schema, not hub tables
- No parameterized inputs — named queries are fixed SELECT statements with no user-supplied values

Example (`src/queries/open_tasks.sql`):

```sql
SELECT
  t.id,
  t.title,
  t.assignee_id,
  t.due_date,
  t.priority,
  l.name AS list_name
FROM tasks t
LEFT JOIN lists l
  ON l.id = t.list_id
  AND l.household_id = t.household_id
WHERE t.household_id = current_setting('app.household_id', true)::uuid
  AND t.completed = 0
ORDER BY t.due_date NULLS LAST, t.priority DESC
LIMIT 200
```

### DB apps — named INSERT operations

AI INSERT access requires an additional validation layer because the AI client supplies the data values. Each named insert has two bundle files:

**`src/inserts/{name}.sql`** — the INSERT SQL. User-supplied params use `$1`, `$2`, etc. System values are generated by SQL built-ins — never rely on the AI client to supply IDs, household_id, or timestamps:

```sql
INSERT INTO items (
  id, household_id, name, name_normalized, added_by_name, created_at
) VALUES (
  gen_random_uuid()::text,
  current_setting('app.household_id', true)::uuid,
  $1,
  lower(trim($1)),
  'AI',
  NOW()::text
)
ON CONFLICT (household_id, name_normalized) DO NOTHING
```

**`src/schemas/{name}.json`** — JSON Schema (draft-07) describing the user-supplied params array. The hub validates params against this schema before executing the SQL:

```json
{
  "type": "array",
  "items": [
    { "type": "string", "minLength": 1, "maxLength": 200, "description": "item name" }
  ],
  "minItems": 1,
  "maxItems": 1
}
```

Declare in the manifest:
```json
"ai_access": {
  "allowed": true,
  "mode": "read_write",
  "db_inserts": ["add_item"]
}
```

**Migration constraints are your second validation layer.** JS validation in the app front-end enforces business rules at runtime, but AI inserts bypass the front-end. Move those constraints into the DB so both paths enforce them:

```sql
-- In a migration: add constraints that the front-end currently enforces in JS
ALTER TABLE items ADD CONSTRAINT items_name_len CHECK (length(name) > 0) IF NOT EXISTS;
ALTER TABLE tasks ADD CONSTRAINT tasks_priority_check CHECK (priority BETWEEN 0 AND 3) IF NOT EXISTS;
ALTER TABLE tasks ADD CONSTRAINT tasks_list_fk FOREIGN KEY (list_id) REFERENCES lists(id) IF NOT EXISTS;
```

**SQL file rules (enforced by hub at runtime and tested by CI):**
- Must start with `INSERT`
- Must contain `household_id` (set via `current_setting()`, never from params)
- User params are positional (`$1`, `$2` — max 50)
- System values always come from SQL built-ins: `gen_random_uuid()`, `current_setting()`, `NOW()`
- Include `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` or `DO UPDATE` where duplicates are possible

**Schema file rules:**
- Must be valid JSON Schema (draft-07)
- Use `items` (array form) for tuple/positional validation, not `prefixItems`
- Declare `minItems` and `maxItems` to match the SQL param count
- Add format constraints (`pattern`, `minLength`, `maxLength`, `minimum`, `maximum`) to catch bad input before it reaches the DB

### Privacy and admin overrides

- Apps with no `ai_access` field (or `allowed: false`) are completely invisible to MCP clients — they do not appear in `list_apps` results and their data cannot be accessed
- A hub admin can set `disabled: true` via `PATCH /api/apps/{id}/ai-access` to block MCP access for any app regardless of its manifest
- Admins cannot *enable* AI access for an app that declared `allowed: false` — only the manifest can grant it
- Consider whether your app contains sensitive content before enabling `ai_access`. Couples apps, therapy journals, and similar private apps should leave `allowed: false`
